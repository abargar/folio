CS6535 project - Android application

An application for collecting and organizing multimedia data.  
It's broken down into three main parts:

###1. Capturing data:
  This app syncs up with other applications on the device to collect the following multimedia files:
	* Images
	* Video
	* Audio
	* Text

  Each file is timestamped and geo-located at time of capture.

###2. Viewing data:
  Data can be viewed in either a list or map format.  Colors on the map correspond to the type of data captured (ie orange for image, purple for video).  Data can also be ordered by name, or filtered by custom tags.

###3. Detailing and sharing data:
  Files can be given custom names or tags.  From the details page, you can choose to share the file in a number of different ways, including email, Google Drive, Facebook, or Evernote.
